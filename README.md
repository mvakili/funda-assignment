# Funda Assignment
This is an assignment for funda .Net developer role 
## TL;DR

This is a little bit weird to me. I don't usually write my thoughts about the code as a markdown, piece of paper is much preferred. Since this repo is going to reveal my skills to funda guys, I put everything comes to my mind about the assignment here.

## Purpose
This project shows top Makelaars in Amsterdam. We have 2 makelaars list:
 - Top 10 Makelaars in Amsterdam with most objects for sale
 - Top 10 Makelaars in Amsterdam with most objects with tuin for sale

## Where we are standing and what we are supposed to do?

 - We have an API endpoint using that we can retrieve all objects listed for sale in Amsterdam

 - There is an API throttling limiting the number of requests to <=100 per minute

- We need to avoid errors and have an appropriate way to handle errors

- The solution should be testable

- Separation of concerns is important
